# YOLOv4-Vehicles-localization-and-classification
Vehicle detection in the real time has to be very quick and accurate. This is an exercise to train YOLOv4 on the custom data set. Collected the images of Bikes and cars, created the bounding boxes and labelled the images manually using labelimg tool . Created train and test text files with the paths along with .data file. These files are copied to data folder after cloning the darknet folder. Make file in darknet folder is updated with the required binary input parameters  for GPU, CUDNN, OPENCV..etc. Updated the Yolov4.cfg file with the required parameters for batch sizes, steps, filters, classes..etc. Trained the model using yolov4.weights transfer learning. Predictions are very fast and 100% accurate when tested on random images.
